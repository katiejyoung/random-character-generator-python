# Random Character Generator - Python Practice
Random character generator implemented using python

## Requirements

In a file called "mypython.py", create a program that, when executed, creates 3 files in the same directory as your script, each named differently. Each of these 3 files must contain exactly 10 random characters from the lowercase alphabet, with no spaces ("hoehdgwkdq", for example). The final (eleventh) character of each file MUST be a newline character. Additional runs of the script should not append to the files. Thus, running wc (wordcount) against your files must always return 11.

When executed, output sent to stdout should first print out the contents of the 3 files it is creating in exactly the format given below.
After the file contents of all three files have been printed, print out two random integers each on a separate line (whose range is from 1 to 42, inclusive).
Finally, on the last (sixth) line, print out the product of the two numbers.
You do not have to parse and read the data back in from the files created in step 2 in order to complete step 3. For step 3, just dump the contents that you already randomly generated in your program directly onto the screen, if that's the easiest way for you. 

### To run the program:
1. Type "python3 mypython.py"
