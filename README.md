# Random Character Generator - Python Practice

## Requirements

In a file called "mypython.py", create a program that, when executed, creates 3 files in the same directory as your script, each named differently. 

Each of these 3 files must contain exactly 10 random characters from the lowercase alphabet, with no spaces ("hoehdgwkdq", for example). The final (eleventh) character of each file MUST be a newline character. Additional runs of the script should not append to the files. Thus, running wc (wordcount) against your files must always return 11.

## Steps
1. When executed, output sent to stdout should first print out the contents of the 3 files.
2. After the file contents of all three files have been printed, print out two random integers each on a separate line (whose range is from 1 to 42, inclusive).
3. Finally, on the last (sixth) line, print out the product of the two numbers.

### To run the program:
1. Type "python3 mypython.py"
